### warning
V1.0.0 is an alpha version to make a stucture. 

I've a 250, so profiles is now for 250, 
i've prepared section for xt and xt-350, and except 350 size, it share actually same settings as 250.

Profiles for 250 should kind of work as it's more or less a copy from my old profiles, 
but i've probably lost settings during restructuration, as they are lot of change between file structure.

Made a small test before using the profile
I'll for sure require test and tuning before validate thoe profiles. Any help, advice is welcome!
